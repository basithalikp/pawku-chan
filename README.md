## Basic Details
### Team Name: Byte Quest

- Member 2: Gautam Krishna - NSS College of Engineering, Palakkad

### Project Description
Pawku-Chan is a mischievous, anime-inspired desktop pet designed to bring quirky chaos and whimsical fun to your workspace! It randomly renames your files with artistic, emotional names and rearranges your desktop icons into "modern art" patterns. Perfect for fans of anime charm and playful, useless projects.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Is your desktop far too organized and sensible? Do your files have boring, descriptive names? Are your icons just sitting in predictable rows and columns?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Pawku-Chan will artistically ruin your well-ordered desktop! It gives files dramatic, poetic names like "Ethereal_Sorrow.docx" and shuffles your icons into patterns that only make sense in an alternate anime universe. Your workspace will never be boring again!
